# Environment Setup Guide

This project uses environment variables stored in a `.env` file to configure sensitive information securely.

## 1. Create a `.env` File

Inside the root directory of the project, create a new file named `.env` and add the following content:

```
# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## 2. Obtain an OpenAI API Key

If you do not have an OpenAI API key, follow these steps:

1. Go to [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. Sign in or create an account.
3. Navigate to the API Keys section and generate a new API key.
4. Copy the key and paste it into your `.env` file.
